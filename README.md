Note: This repository previously contained a large simulation output file (>50 MB), which caused it to take a long time to download / clone when using a slow internet connection. This and another moderately large file have been removed from the repository but can be downloaded from elsewhere (see the [**Output files**](#output) section for more details) or recreated using the code provided.

If you have questions or comments, please contact the repository maintainer, Juliet Pulliam, at <pulliam@sun.ac.za>.

## Software requirements

- R - a statistical programming language (download links for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Linux](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/), and [MacOS](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/))
- R Studio (recommended)- a user interface for R ([download link](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))

The following R packages are required to run the code in this repository (version numbers indicate the versions used for manuscript preparation):

- coda (0.19-4)
- colorspace (2.0-1)
- data.table (1.14.0)
- ggplot2 (3.3.4)
- hexbin (1.28.2)
- jsonlite (1.7.2)
- lme4 (1.1-27.1)
- Matrix (1.3-4)
- patchwork (1.1.1)

## Pipeline files

The files listed below are located in the main directory:

- `Makefile` - full pipeline via GNU Make (requires use of Unix-like command line); see <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/> for more information
- `pub.json` - configuration file used for manuscript preparation
- `test.json` - test configuration file (useful to see how the code works without requiring intensive computation)
- `reinfections_pub.Rproj` - R project file, which can be used for easy file navigation in interactive mode
- `LICENSE` - license information
- `README.md` - this file
- `.gitignore` - specifies files and file types for version control to ignore

## Data files

The files listed below are located in the `data` subdirectory:

- `ts_data.csv` - national daily time series of newly detected putative primary infections (`inc_1`) and suspected reinfections (`inc_2`) by specimen receipt date (`date`)
- `demog_data.csv` - counts of individuals eligible for reinfection (`total`), who have 0 suspected reinfections (`no_reinf`) or >0 suspected reinfections (`reinf`) by province (`province`), age group (5-year bands, `agegrp5`), and sex (M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown, `sex`)

Derived data files created by certain scripts will also be placed in this subdirectory.

## Code files

The files listed below are located in the `code` subdirectory:

#### Data preparation scripts

- `prep_ts_data.R` - creates an RDS file with time series data (used in analysis / plotting scripts)
- `prep_demog_data.R` - creates an RData file with counts by province and counts by age group / sex combination (used in analysis / plotting scripts)

Files generated by these scripts will be placed in the `data` subdirectory and will be ignored by the version control system.

#### Utility scripts

- `install.R` - checks for required packages and installs if not present
- `empirical_hazard_fxn.R` - utility functions for empirical hazard estimation (approach 2)
- `fit_fxn_null.R` - utility functions for likelihood calculations (approach 1)
- `plotting_fxns.R` - utility functions for formatting plots
- `wave_defs.R` - utility functions for defining wave periods

Utility functions generated by these scripts will be placed in the `utils` subdirectory and will be ignored by the version control system.

#### Analysis and visualization scripts

_Descriptive_:

- `ts_plot.R` - creates time series plot (Figure 1)
- `demog_plot.R` - creates descriptive analysis plot (Figure 2, panels B and C)

_Approach 1_:

- `mcmc_fit.R` - implements MCMC fitting for approach 1
- `sim_null.R` - simulates projections from the null model for approach 1 using a simplified simulation approach
- `sim_null_dyn.R` - simulates projections from the null model for approach 1 using an approach that includes dynamical noise (Note: Not used; see file for additional information.)
- `sim_plot.R` - creates plot of observed data with model fits and projections using approach 1 (Figure 3)
- `convergence_plot.R` - creates plot of convergence diagnostics using output of the MCMC fitting procedure (Figure S4)

_Approach 2_:

- `emp_haz_plot.R` - creates empirical hazards plot using approach 2 (Figure 4)
- `reconstruct_data_for_reg.R` - creates reconstructed data set using model for approach 2, to be used in regression analysis
- `reg_out.R` - conducts Poisson regression analysis and outputs estimates of coefficients with 95% confidence intervals
- `sens_an.R` - conducts sensitivity analysis to assumptions about observation probabilities for approach 2
- `sens_an_plot.R` - creates sensitivity analysis plot (Figure S5)
