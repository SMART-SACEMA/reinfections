- TO BE ADDED

## Pipeline files

The files listed below are located in the main directory:

- `Makefile` - TO BE ADDED
- `pub.json` - configuration file used for manuscript preparation
- `test.json` - test configuration file (useful to see how the code works without requiring intensive computation)

- `LICENSE` - license information
- `README.md` - this file
- `.gitignore` - specifies files and file types for version control to ignore

## Data files

The files listed below are located in the `data` subdirectory:

- `ts_data.csv` - national daily time series of newly detected putative primary infections (`inc_1`) and suspected reinfections (`inc_2`) by specimen receipt date (`date`)
- `demog_data.csv` - counts of putative primary infections and suspected reinfections by province, age group (5-year bands), and sex (M, F, U)

## Code files

The files listed below are located in the `code` subdirectory:

- TO BE ADDED

## Output files

The files listed below are located in the `output` subdirectory:

- `posterior_90_null.RData` - posterior samples from the MCMC fitting procedure (as used in the manuscript)
- `sim_90_null.RDS` - simulation results (as used in the manuscript)

Files generated by the code in this repository will also generally be stored in this subdirectory.
