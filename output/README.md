Output files will be stored in this subdirectory but will be ignored by git (edit the .gitignore file in the main directory to change this default behavior). Note that some output files are large and should not be committed. The following two files have been removed from the repository's history as of commit `bb9beaf` to reduce the size of the repository:

- `posterior_90_null.RData` - posterior samples from the MCMC fitting procedure
